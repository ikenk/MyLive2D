#  MyLive2D

**English** | [简体中文](./Docs/README.zh-CN.md) | [日本語](./Docs/README.ja.md)

## Introduction
This is a Live2D project based on Apple Metal and RealityKit, which can run on iPhone and iPad devices with **iOS 16.3 or later**.

## Motivation
Since I really like the game **Azur Lane** and the anime **Frieren: Beyond Journey's End**, I wanted to see if it was possible to use Live2D technology to place Frieren and Fern on my iPhone and iPad.

## Installation Instructions 
After downloading, open the `MyLive2D.xcodeproj` project file with Xcode. Then, in the left navigation area, select **MyLive2D** under **TARGETS**. On the top of the right editor area, select **Signing & Capability**, and finally set the **Team** option to your own developer account.

## Ackonwledgement
